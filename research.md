## Overview: Unraveling the Non-Coding "Dark Genome" in Evolution and Disease

<p>My research focuses on the, less explored, non-coding repetitive genomic elements—once dismissed as *"junk DNA"* but now recognized as crucial drivers of genome evolution and disease development.</p>

Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, I analyze large-scale genomic datasets to uncover the regulatory and functional roles of the complex part of genome, so called **"dark genome"**. My work investigates how these non-coding elements influence coding gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and epigenetic modifications.

I am particularly intrigued by **transposable elements (TEs)**—mobile genetic elements that shape genome evolution and important to impact gene expression. By studying their impact on gene expression and chromatin dynamics, I aim to reveal their broader functional significance.

With expertise in *bioinformatics* and *computational genomics*, I apply advanced analytical tools for *comparative genomics*, *transcriptomics*, *epigenomics* data analysis, to extract meaningful biological insights. My research integrates computational approaches with molecular and cell biology to decode non-coding regulatory networks.

In my research methods, I employ, develop and optimize computational pipelines for multi-omics data integration. Broadly, my research bridges the gap between experimental and computational biology, offering new insights into non-coding genome repeats and their potential as therapeutic targets in disease, such as in leukemia (see my current research).
